## Good Practices for Software Development
### Questions

**1. Which point(s) were new to you?**
- **Gathering requirements**
    - I should write down the requirements myself and share them with the team. This will help me get immediate feedback and serve as a reference for future conversations.
    - Despite all efforts, requirements can sometimes remain vague. So, during the implementation phase, I should get frequent feedback to ensure I'm on track and everyone is on the same page.
- **Always over communicate**
    - I should use group chats or channels for communication most of the time, as this is preferable over private chats.
    - I should avoid missing calls. If I can't talk immediately, I should receive the call and inform the caller that I'll call back in 5-10 minutes, and then do so.
    - During meetings, I should keep my video turned on to improve rapport with my team and help enhance communication.
- **Stuck? Ask questions**
    - I need to ask questions in a way that make it very easy for the person to understand then answer. Vague messages won't get me the answers I'm looking for.
    - I should use screenshots, diagrams, and screencast tools to show and explain my issues.
    - I should use Github gists to share code snippets and sandbox environments like Codepen or Codesandbox to share the entire setup.
- **Get to know your teammates**
    - I should make time for my company, the product I'm working on, and my team members. This will help a lot in improving my communication with the team.
    - I should try to find out my team members' work schedules and set up calls when they are free.
- **Be aware and mindful of other team members**
    - It won't always be possible for my team members to get on a call with me. Instead, I can send a WhatsApp message. I should write down all my questions and send them as a single message rather than bombarding them with messages.
    - I should be available when someone replies to my message.
    - I need to remember that my colleagues/team members have their own work to do as well. I should pick and choose my communication medium depending on the situation.
- **Doing things with 100% involvement**
    - I should get better in preserving attention.
    - I should always keep my phone on silent and remove notifications from the home screen. I should only keep notifications from work-related apps.

**2. Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?** 
  - I should work on knowing my colleagues' schedules so that I can get their help when needed without disturbing their activities. To make progress, I can create a shared calendar or use scheduling tools to see when my teammates are available.
  - I need to communicate with clear points and stick to the topic rather than looping around it. I must ensure that my questions are specific and take responsibility for making them clear. To improve, I will practice writing concise messages and use tools like screenshots or screencasts to provide context.
  - I should develop a habit of communicating in group chats or on calls rather than DMing in personal chats. This ensures transparency and allows more team members to be aware of ongoing discussions. To make this a habit, I will start by moving important conversations to group channels and encourage others to do the same.
  - I should be alert for company-related notifications. To improve, I will configure my notification settings to prioritize work-related apps and keep my phone on silent to minimize distractions.
  - I should turn on my video during meetings to improve rapport with my team and enhance communication. To make this a habit, I'll remind myself before meetings and ensure my workspace is video-ready.
  - I must be mindful of other team members' workloads. If they can't get on a call, I'll send a comprehensive message with all my questions at once rather than bombarding them with multiple messages. I'll also ensure I'm available for real-time conversations to speed up resolutions.
  - I need to preserve my attention and focus on tasks with 100% involvement. I will keep my phone on silent, remove non-essential notifications. Regular exercise will also help maintain my energy levels throughout the day.
