# Learning process
## Questions
1. **What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.**
- The Feynman technique is a learning method that focuses on explaining a concept to someone in a clear and
simple manner (in basic words). If the concept can't be explained clearly, then you do not understand it well.
2. **In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**
- Salvador Dali takes a break from painting when he is stuck on something. During the break he sits on a chair with keys and rests.
When he dozes off into sleep, the keys in his hand would slip and fall and create a clutter noise.
He wakes up from this noise and then is focused from a fresh state of mind.
3. **What are active and diffused modes of thinking?**
- Active modes are focused modes, where we put all our attention on a problem and think of a solution.
In contrast, diffuse mode is a relaxed mode after taking a break from focusing on something and later seeing a
different perspective to approach a problem, or having an insight when processing information passively.

4. **According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.**
 - Deconstruct the skill.
 - Learn enough to self correct.
 - Remove practice barriers.
 - Practice at least 20 hours.
     
   
6. **What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?**
- If I am not satisfied with the answers written in the manuals or on different websites, I will watch a video and let someone explain them with animations.
- I will monitor my activity on my phone by checking the screen time.
- If I am stuck on a problem, I will browse through the web and search for the solution myself before asking my colleagues, AI and mentors.
  With this exploration, I might find problems relevant to mine and alternative ways to tackle it.
- After getting a solution from the web, I won't copy the answer but rather type it. This will let me examine each word written in the solution.
- I will set reminders on my laptop to take breaks at work.
