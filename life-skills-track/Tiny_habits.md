### Question 2
How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.
- Behavior = Motivation Ability Prompt (B = MAP)
- In order to have a new desired habit, we need to shrink the habit into tiniest version of itself, so that it require less motivation.
- Identify the action prompt: An action prompt is one which motivates to pickup next tiny habit, without disrupting your momentum. Like taking garbage after cleaning kitchen. Or floss one tooth after brushing.

### Question 3
Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)
- It is important to celebrate after each successful completion of habit because When we celebrate a habit, we create a positive association with the behavior. This positive reinforcement increases the likelihood that we will continue the habit.

### Question 4
In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
- The story of how people started drinking water more than they drink soda is fascinating.
If we split this behavior into 4 things:
1. Noticing: Both soda and water were offered.
2. Wanting: People started to have water because a option was presented in front of them.
3. Doing: When people see water, the feel thirsty, and they pickup water rather than soda.
4. Liking: After having cold water, people started to like the after effect.

### Question 5
What is the James's perspective about Identity?
- According to James Clear, our current behaviors are simply a reflection of our current identity. What we do now is a mirror image of the type of person we believe that we are (either consciously or subconsciously).
- To change our behavior for good, we need to start believing new things about ourself. We need to build identity-based habits.
- Identity refers to our worldview, our self-image, our judgments about ourself and others. Most of the beliefs, assumptions, and biases we hold are associated with identity. To change that, we must follow two steps.
1. Decide the type of person we want to be.
2. Prove it to ourself with small hanits.

### Question 6
Write about the James's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?
To make an habit easier to perform,
- Begin with a tiniest version of the habit (Like taking garbage out regularly).
- Link to Existing Routines: Linking to existing habit creates an action prompt, there by self motivating (Like taking garbage out after we clean kitchen)
- Optimizing Environment: Modify surroundings to facilitate the habit. (Keeping waste bin in clear view rather than hidden in cabinet, so everytime we see the bin, we are reminded to take the trash out).

### Question 7
Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?
- To make an habit harder to do, we can create as much of obstacles to make the habit less convenient.
- Changing the environment, and adding inhibitors to increase behavioral resistance and make unwanted habits harder to execute.
- changing cues, and using commitment devices to disrupt the habit loop and make habits harder to perform.

## 5. Reflection:

### Question 8:
Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

- I want to have an habit of cleaning my room every morning.
- The tinniest habit that I want to takeup is to clean the screen of my laptop every time I clean my specs.
- Looking a screen dust and smudge free is satisying and its easy to do, since I already have cleaning fluid and tissues to clean my specs, I will put a little effort to clean the laptop screen.

### Question 9:
Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

- I want to eliminate stuffing socks into shoe after i removed them, I want to put them into laundry basket. 
- To do this, I will drop my bag down while I remove my shoe, and while picking my bag up again, I will also pick the socks.
- Keeping a small laundry basket next to shoe rack.
