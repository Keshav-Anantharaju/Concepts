- The speaker aimed to predict which students had the highest IQ and which cadets would stay through the entire training at the military school. She evaluated individuals based on their IQ scores and test performance but often found her predictions to be incorrect. The speaker explains that it is not necessarily intelligence or test scores that determine success, but rather the quality of grit. Grit, she asserts, is not measured by specific parameters but is instead a result of the motivation and support provided by educators, teachers, and mentors to help individuals persevere and achieve their long-term goals.
