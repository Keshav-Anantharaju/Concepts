# Sexual Harassment

## Questions

### 1. What kind of behavior causes sexual harassment?
- Specific behaviors or actions that can create a hostile environment and quid pro quo.
- Unwelcome verbal, visual, or physical conduct of a sexual nature.
- Putting one person at an advantage over another person because the first person is sexually attractive or in a sexual relationship.

### 2. What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behavior?
- Say `Stop` or `No` to the person/offender.
- Report to the supervisor, HR, or any other person in the chain of command.

### 3. Explain different scenarios enacted by actors.
- **Artistic freedom:** A female employee is offended when a male employee puts up a poster of a girl in a seductive dress.
- **Ya gotta keep trying:** A male employee is irritated when a female employee repeatedly asks to go on a date even after continuous rejection.
- **The joke's on you:** An employee is irritated when she receives an email about a joke of a sexual nature.
- **The legend:** A female employee squirms when a male employee offers her a hug even after denial.
- **Odd man out:** A female employee feels demotivated when her supervisor gives most of his attention to another female employee who is charming and sexually attractive.
- **The contract:** A male employee is asked for personal attention to get a job done.
- **Twisted words:** A colleague provides suggestive comments of a sexual nature to his fellow employee to get a job done.
- **Equal appreciation:** A colleague might not like similar compliments from everyone.
- **Everyone loves a compliment:** An employee does not like receiving compliments on her looks from her supervisor, even if it's not of a sexual nature. She becomes nervous when she receives compliments on her looks.
- **Testing the waters:** An employee is called into her supervisor's office to receive congratulations for her work. But the supervisor appreciates her personally (as a personal interest), seeking any positive/mutual reaction from her, but it makes the employee nervous.

### 4. How to handle cases of harassment.
1. Say `Stop` or `No` to the person who is offending you.
2. If the offender does not stop, follow your organizationâ€™s grievance procedure, or take help from your supervisor. If the supervisor is the offender, then report it to his/her supervisor or someone in HR or another person you feel comfortable with up the chain of command.

### 5. How to behave appropriately
1. Ask yourself, 'Would you do or say the same thing in the exact same way if your wife, husband, son, daughter, or other loved ones were standing right next to you?'
2. Is what you are doing potentially crossing a personal or physical boundary of another person?
3. Has the person given you notice in any way?
4. Don't do, say, display, or send anything that is a sexual suggestion or joke of a sexual nature in the workplace.
